Knowledge and Hard Skills Learning Progressions 

## Algorithm-wise:

- Interpretation in Neural Networks: 

	***Month-2 (01/May – 31/May) ~ Month-6 (01/Sept – 29/Sept)***

	Monthly course-meetings provided by the department where the advanced programmers talk about the forefront topics in AI neural networks and their previous achievements utilising these technologies and how to apply them to the current projects. These courses have boosted my learning progress and granted me with inspirations in interpretations in semantic segmentations, ReID, mutual learning and etc. this course vastly deepened my understandings in how my work will benefit the AI in facial recognition.

- ###Imaging Theory & Reducing Complexity:
 
	***Stage 1: Week-06 (19/May – 25/May) ~ Week-08 (02/Jun – 08/Jun) </br> Stage 2: Week-21 (01/Sept – 07/Sept) ~ Week-24 (22/Sept – 28/Sept + 29/Sept (contract end date))***

	During stage 1, I followed online tutorials and applied the knowledge inherited from DE3 robotics module to acquire sufficient understanding of how translation and rotation matrices manipulate the camera view coordinate systems. In addition, I looked into the physics theories about the effect of focus and ambient, diffuse and specular lighting on the objects and materials and applied the equations to create vivid Phong lighting effects.
	
	During stage 2, I have been researching on open-source project on Github, and consecutively analysing on the speed results applying various algorithms in details, I have gained a glimpse of insight into the internal relationships between various ways of rendering and the compute power utilised and how to reduce the algorithm complexity in order to boost the efficiency of generation.

# Next Step:

## OpenGL:

- **Sky Box Background Scene Reconstruction**

## GIMP?

- **Plug-in / Fu-Script Writing**


back-light


## inspirations:

### Depth Mapping method, why Bu\_Kao\_Pu?!

### OpenGL speed vs. OpenCV speed in large bulk rendering

### off-screen rendering

### c++ multi-threading

- https://solarianprogrammer.com/2011/12/16/cpp-11-thread-tutorial/
- http://www.runoob.com/cplusplus/cpp-multithreading.html

### python script executing terminal commands with CPU multi-processing

### traverse files in a directory

## algorithm-wisely

### filtering & mip-mapping

- nearest
- linear
- anisotropic 

## researches: ways that don't work:

### unity-plugin


## future: room for optimisation:

### shaders --> optimise vertex shader





### cover: glasses, mouth-mask
