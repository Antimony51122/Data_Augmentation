	Team Cloth Design
</h1>

Apart from all those coding works, frequent mobilisation activities were held to bring fun to the team. During one celebration activity for the delivery of the Car ID Recognition part, I took the responsibility to design a team cloth and slogan. 

The slogan "Let the World recognize us" has double meanings: the ostensible meaning is letting the world recognise our team due that we are the forefront of video surveillance AI. Another meaning behind is hidden in the word "recognize" which can be both interpreted as realisation of a being or the technological recognition of an ID using the AI.

The idea of the cloth was using transformers as the main character and place a scene of each of them in car mode in the front and robot mode in the back. Accompanying by the slogan, expressing the funny meaning that our algorithm is powerful enough to recognise the robot ID of a certain transformer from their car mode.
