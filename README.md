# Industrial Placement Project Work and Outputs



**NOTE**: mind that most of work I have done during my placement has been specified containing sensitive contents, therefore, after negotiation with the industry tutor, it has bee agreed that, project works cannot be shown directly, but, I am allowed to use the same technique learnt from the placement and produce something else that is not straightly related to the interest of the company.
