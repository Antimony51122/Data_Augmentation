**NOTE**: mind that most of work I have done during my placement has been specified containing sensitive contents, therefore, after negotiation with the industry tutor, it has been agreed that, project works cannot be shown directly, but, I am allowed to use the same technique learnt from the placement and produce something else that is not straightly related to the interest of the company with providing very little portion of the source code.



Before directly aimlessly going into coding, it was more targeted to start with applying design engineering agile
approaching idea of rapid prototyping. I firstly try to investigate how environmental effects on camera lens can
influence the imaging. Then produce a rapid prototyping with Photoshop filters, After Effect 3Ds or GIMP tools
and try to deeply understand the logic behind parameters in each layer of filter and the influence of order of
layers.
